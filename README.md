# Loops-and-Functions
A main() function where the user is asked what function he/she
wants to use until she chooses “Exit”.

#Task to complete 

In this exercise you will build a calculator with a specific set of functions. This will consist of

 A main() function where you will keep asking the user what function she wants to use until she chooses “Exit”
   The user should be presented with the following screen:

      Type your option:

         1: Average

         2: Factorial

         3: Square root

         4: Exit

Three functions that are called from the main function
A average function that receives 3 floating point numbers and returns the average of those 3 numbers
A factorial function that receives an integer and returns the factorial of that integer
A square_root function that receives an integer and returns the square root. If there is no integer solution it returns -1
After the user chooses the option the main function should ask for the appropriate values and pass them to the functions. The main function should also print the results.
